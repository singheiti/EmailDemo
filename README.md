This is a small demo of how any mailbox will work. It implements a very basic functionality of the same wherein we will click on the folder and we will get the data accordingly. For now, the data is hardcoded, but we can always make an API call and fetch the data.
Also, there is no use of any external library(as per the requirement), however we can use react-bootstrap, material-ui and redux to make the code cleaner.
The entry point is index.js where we are calling App.js wherein all the architecture of the application has been defined.

To start with it, follow the below steps:
1) git clone --branch master https://github.com/singheiti/EmailDemo/tree/master
2) cd EmailDemo
3) npm install / yarn install
4) npm start / npm install
